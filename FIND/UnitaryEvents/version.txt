Unitary Events Analysis Software

UE Version 2.3  (SG, Sept 2005, Berlin)
---------------------------------------

Most of the code has already been ported to matlab 5. 
A few warnings due to obsolete graphics commands      
remain. Expect bad output formatting, because we still 
use pre TeX notation. A lot of our odd matlab 4       
work arounds are still in the code.

Call 'InstallUE' on the matlab prompt to compile the
code and to create a standalone version.
                
This is the GUI-version of the UE analysis program,
start the gui by typing 'startue' on the matlab prompt.

This version also allows for distributed processing
(using PVM) on a linux cluster or on a shared memory 
parallel machine (see Fliegner et al (2003) Proc 4th
German Neurosci Meeting, p. 592).   

The code implemented is described in
Gruen, Diesmann, Aertsen (2002a,b) Neural 
Computation, 14(1): 43-80, 81-119

The option to calculate trial-by-trial expectancy is
described in 
Gruen, Riehle, Diesmann (2003) Biological 
Cybernetics 88(5): 335-351 

The implemented code of the Combined Shuffling and Resampling
method (CSR) is described in
Pipa & Gruen (2003) Neurocomputing 52-54: 31-37.

 
UEParameters_Default.mat (data14.gdf, simulates data in Riehle 
et al (1997), Fig 4a), data12Param.mat (data12.gdf)
and data13Param.mat (data13.gdf, simulates data in Riehle 
et al (1997), Fig 1) are example analysis scripts that analyze 
simulated data sets.
